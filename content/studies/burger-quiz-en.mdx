### Project details
In 2018, the famouse game of Alain Chabat is back on French television. It's board games promise to retrieve at home the TV show's ambiance, with fiends for family. Unfortunately, the interactive screens and buzzers are missing.

As a challenge, I built those UIs using web technologies to recreate the interactions between the players, the pleasure to see its score gauge being filled up, the jingles between every game rounds...

### Highlights

- Admin dashboard to manage the game
- Burger shaped gauges
- Individuals buzzers
- Real time server based on Socket.io
- Frontend: ReactJS + SCSS
- Backend: Express + PostgreSQL
- Hosted on Heroku

### Year
2018
