## Hi, I'm Johan 👋

I am a software engineer, specialized in **website and applications development in JavaScript**, React and NodeJS.

🎓 I left my native Brittanny at 18 to study in Picardie, where I got a technical degree in software development at [Université Picardie Jules Verne of Amiens](https://www.iut-amiens.fr/). I then graduated from a MSc in Computer Engineering at the [Technical University of Compiegne](https://www.utc.fr/). By the end, I got the opportunity to finish my studies at the [Technical University of Sofia](http://www.fuf.bg/fr) in Bulgaria, for 6 months.

🐘 Back in France, I settled down in Nantes to start my professional journey. I perfected my technical extertise within several companies of the digital network (check [my online resume](https://www.doyoubuzz.com/johan-soulet) for more details).

👨‍💻 I entered the development field through front-end development. I discovered and fine-tuned my skills with **React**, then I added other strings to my bow : **NodeJS** for backend development, **React Native and Expo** for native mobile apps. Moreover, I've always cared about putting the humans beeings in the center of the design process, that is why I got interested in **agile product management** and crafting **accessible UIs**.

🔥 Recently, I enhanced the quality of the projects I'm working on thanks to test driven development (unit and functional testing) and TypeScript compilation. Also, I learned Gatsby and Next.js to build modern and strong static websites.

### Out of the code

🤝 Early in my teenage years, I discovered the non-profit sector and I never left it since. I got involved into social projects as a director of summer camps for childrens, cultural projects by organising film and theatre festivals or sport as a member, since 2014, of the [Jules Vénères](https://www.facebook.com/lesjulesveneres/), the male roller derby team from Nantes, a contact sport on roller skates.

🌱 In my personal life, I claim equal rights regardless of gender, origin, religion... and respect of the environment and animals.
